# Text Editors in CLI

1. Nano

most importantly nano is simple and very intuitive. All the navigation and usage options are listed in the bottom of the screen. It offers basic text editing features and mostly used to write just a couple of lines to the file then save and exit. (❁´◡`❁)

2. ed

ed is a line based text editor. It is a very simple text editor and it is not very user friendly. It is mostly used to edit files that are not very big. It is not very popular and it is not used very often. ❌

To use it you just give it line number and it will display that single line for you. to write just start writing. I don't care to learn how to save the file.

I thing to know is how to quit it. Just press `ctrl + d`. The changes will not be saved automatically.
It is an ancestor of vi editor.

3. ex

ex is improved version of ed. It is now subpart of vim.

4. Vim

Vim is good.
`i` to go in insert mode
`esc` to go back to normal mode

- `:wq` to save and quit
- `:q!` to quit without saving

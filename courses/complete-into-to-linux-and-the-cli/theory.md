## Notes

- `BASH` stands for **Bourne Again Shell**
- The commands you run on the CLI are saved so, be careful when running commands with sensitive information.
- Copy and Pasting from the Internet should be done carefully as wrong commands can cause damage to your system, and some of them may be malicious. So the key is to read and understand the commands before running them.

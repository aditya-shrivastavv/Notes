# Cleaning the C Drive

1. Go through native folders.

   - Desktop
   - Documents
   - Downloads
   - Music
   - Pictures
   - Videos

2. Settings > System > Storage

   - see each category and delete what you don't need
   - make sure to delete the **temporary files**

3. The above Storage section is very helpfull specially in windows 11. There are so many ways you can free up space.

4. Go to `%temp%` folder and delete all the files in it.

5. Go to `C:\Users\Shree\AppData` and look for the folders that are useless. Delete them.
   - `C:\Users\Shree\AppData\Local\Packages` was a huge folder ( > 5gb ) for me. I deleted all the folders in it.
